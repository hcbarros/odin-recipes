        <h3>Description</h3>    
        <p>These baked beans from scratch are made by 
            combining navy beans, molasses, and maple 
            syrup to make this classic dish at home.</p>    

         <h3>Ingredients:</h3>   

         <ul>
            <li>1 cup navy beans, soaked overnight and drained</li>
            <li>4 cups water</li>
            <li>¼ cup ketchup</li>
            <li>¼ cup maple syrup</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons molasses</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon chili powder</li>
            <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
         </ul>       

         <h3>Steps</h3>

         <ol>
              
            <li>Step 1
                <p>
                    Place beans in a large saucepan with 4 cups of water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer 1 hour.
                </p>
            </li>        
            <li>Step 2
                <p>    
                    Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Stir ketchup, maple syrup, brown sugar, molasses, Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper, and chili powder together in a small bowl; set aside.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>Step 3    
                <p>
                    Once beans have simmered for 1 hour, drain, and reserve cooking liquid. Pour beans into a 1 1/2-quart casserole dish; stir in chopped onion and molasses mixture. Stir in enough reserved cooking liquid so sauce covers beans by 1/4 inch.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>Step 4
                <p>    
                    Cover and bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes; reduce heat to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C) and cook 6 hours longer, stirring beans after they have cooked for 3 hours. Once beans are tender and sauce has reduced and is sticky, remove from the oven, stir, recover, and allow to stand 15 minutes before serving.
                </p>        
            </li>
         </ol>
