                    <h2>Description</h2>    
                    <p>My grandmother first served this wonderful dish with 
                        tomatoes fresh from her garden when I was a child. 
                        It's great on a hot day for a crisp side dish. 
                        Often times I use the leftover marinade when the 
                        first batch is gone and add it to the next batch. 
                        It's tangy taste is much loved, even by my non 
                        veggie-loving kids!
                    </p>

                    <h2>Steps</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li><a>Step 1</a>
                            <p>
                                Combine chili-garlic sauce, hoisin sauce, shrimp stock, tomato paste, mirin, sesame oil, 2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger, 1 clove minced garlic, shallot, and cilantro in a blender or small food processor. Pulse several times to chop, then purée, 30 to 45 seconds. Set sauce aside, or refrigerate until needed.
                            </p>
                        </li>        
                        <li><a>Step 2</a>
                            <p>    
                                Heat oil in a large skillet or wok over medium high heat. When oil is hot, add garlic and ginger slices. Cook until browned, watching closely to avoid burning, about 2 minutes. Carefully remove garlic and ginger from the oil and discard.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li><a>Step 3</a> 
                            <p>
                                To the seasoned oil, carefully add shrimp and cook until it just begins to turn pink and curl head to tail, about 2 minutes. Turn shrimp and add prepared sauce. Cook, stirring, until shrimp are bright pink on the outside and the meat is opaque, 2 to 3 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li><a>Step 4</a>
                            <p>    
                                Remove shrimp from the skillet and keep warm. Continue cooking and stirring sauce until thickened and reduced to about 3/4 cup.
                            </p>        
                        </li>
                        <li><a>Step 5</a>
                            <p>
                                Pour thickened sauce over shrimp, and toss to cover.
                            </p>
                        </li>
